This git hub repo is here to showcase projects I have worked on.  

### Astrolabs 
- Performed Aperture photmetry on real stars using various python modules
- Produced a report on which I discovered 4 exoplanets transiting a sun-like star

### C - Fourier Transforms 
- Wrote C code that reads data from the disk (such as acoustic data) and performs discrete Fourier transform on them
- The transform is then written to a file showing the key harmonics present in the data 
- The code works for sampled functions that have both an imaginary and a real part or those just just have a real part.

### Anime API
- Python code that connects to Jikan.moe API to suggest you a new anime to watch based on a genre of your choice (50 genres to pick from)
- You can then choose to add certain anime's to a wishlist.
