__This repo is to showcase various coding projects I have undertaken:__



### C - Fourier Transforms 
- Wrote C code that reads data from the disk (such as acoustic data) and performs discrete Fourier transform on them
- The transform is then written to a file showing the key harmonics present in the data
- The code is first tested by sampling a function (one of which has a real and imaginary part and another that just has a real part)
- The transform is applied to the data and the inverse transform is applied returning the original function showing that it works
- Then the code is tested on more stochastic data. 

### Python - Anime API
- Python code that connects to Jikan.moe API to suggest you a new anime to watch based on a genre of your choice (50 genres to pick from)
- You can then choose to add certain anime's to a wishlist.

### SQL - Database creation for an Art_selling website
- Created a mock database for a scenario in which 2 artists that sometimes collaborate want to sell their work
- Store procedures and triggers are used to interact with the database. 

### Python - Astrolabs 
- Performed Aperture photmetry on real stars using various python modules
- Produced a report on which I discovered 4 exoplanets transiting a sun-like star
